"""How large is the noise floor on lambda2/lambda3, at this acquisition?

Section 4 states that sorted eigenvalues carry a noise floor above one. The
mechanism is degenerate perturbation. If the true tissue is transversely
isotropic, so lambda2 = lambda3, the estimated pair are the eigenvalues of that
value plus the 2x2 noise block projected onto the degenerate eigenspace. For a
block [[a, c], [c, b]] the two eigenvalues separate by

    sqrt((a - b)^2 + 4 c^2)

which is non-negative and strictly positive almost surely. Sorting assigns the
larger to lambda2, so E[lambda2 - lambda3] > 0 strictly, and because the noise
is mean-zero the split is close to symmetric: lambda2 up, lambda3 down. The
separation is first order in the noise standard deviation, not second, which is
why the bias does not vanish quickly as SNR improves.

That argument is exact only where the true eigenvalues are degenerate. Where
lambda2 - lambda3 is already large compared with the noise, the perturbation is
no longer degenerate and the bias is much smaller. White matter in the ALPS
regions sits near lambda2/lambda3 = 1.5, which is the well separated regime, so
the worst case above is not the relevant one and the floor has to be measured
rather than assumed.

This simulates the HCP-A acquisition directly: one shell at b = 1500 with 93
directions, Rician noise at a stated SNR, log-linear tensor fit, sorted
eigenvalues. It reports the recovered ratio as a function of the true ratio,
so the floor at a true ratio of 1 can be read off and compared against the
values the paper reports.

Uses no participant data of any kind, only simulation, so it runs anywhere
with numpy and pandas and reproduces the floor quoted in the paper.
